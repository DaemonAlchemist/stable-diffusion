TODO
====
Clean up txt2img.py code
    - Separate functions for each pipeline
    - Separate common code into utility functions
        - loading images
        - setting scheduler
    - Add support for alternate models
        - Need to determine a way to know if associated models (CN or LoRA) are compatible
Add coordination code between UI and server
     - sampler options
     - controlnet preprocessors
Add support for fine-tuning
    - Inference for LoRA, textual inversion, and dreambooth
    - GUI for training
Movie support
    - Split into images (do we need imageMagick for this?)
    - run conversion on all images
    - Re-combine into movie (do we need imageMagick for this?)
One-click installer
    - Ideally should not require any prerequisites
UX Stuff
